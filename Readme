How to calculate EE/IP/EA for example h2o molecule
1. in folder h2o-
 python h2o.py (this file runs sceom code)- check line 77. If it is
   createop_ipfull - it will calculate IPs
   createop_eafull - it will calculate EAs
   createop_eefull - it will calculate EEs
values are in Hartrees. Printing full excited states energy at the moment. 
2. in folder h2o
 python ibm_paper.py runs qeom as it is in the paper. 
 line 77 takes care of excited manifold as before. 
 print contain redundant excitation energies in the first half. Start
considering the energies in the second half. (call me in case this is
confusing)
3. in folder h2o
 python qse.py runs qse (there are several versions of qse)
this code runs qse that is diagonalization of H in the space of single and
doubly excited manifold.
